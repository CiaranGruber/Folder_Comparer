# Folder_Comparer

Run the files in order to compare the content of different folders.

This can be useful if you have large folders that aren't stored in the cloud and you want to see what differences there are in terms of files.

In order to use this, save a folder by typing 'S' when on the menu and pasting/typing the first folder path.
When you have a folder you wish to compare, type 'C' when on the menu and paste/type the second folder path when prompted. From there, the program will compare files and show a table at the end with the differences in both folders.
